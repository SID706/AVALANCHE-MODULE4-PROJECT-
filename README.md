# AVALANCHE-MODULE4-PROJECT
It seems like you want a README file to document the code you've provided. A README file typically contains information about what the code does, how to use it, and any important considerations. Here's a basic README template for your Solidity contract:

```markdown
# DEGEN Token Contract

DEGEN is a simple Ethereum token (ERC-20) implemented as a Solidity smart contract.

## Contract Details

- **Name**: DEGEN
- **Symbol**: DGN
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Total Supply**: Initially set to 0

## Functions

### Minting

The `mint` function allows the owner of the contract to create new tokens and assign them to a specific address.

Usage:
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public
```

### Burning

The `burn` function allows token holders to destroy their tokens, effectively reducing the total supply.

Usage:
```solidity
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) public
```

### Redeeming Game Items

The `redeem` function lets token holders redeem their tokens for specific game items. There are three game items, and each has a different token requirement.

Usage:
```solidity
function redeem(address to, uint256 amount, uint256 gameItem) public
```

### Transferring Tokens

The `transfer` function enables token holders to send tokens to another address.

Usage:
```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public
```

## Ownership

The contract has an `owner` address, who can mint new tokens. The initial owner is the address that deploys the contract.

## License

This contract is released under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Usage

To deploy this contract, you can use tools like Remix or Truffle. Ensure you have the required gas for contract deployment.

## Security Considerations

- Be cautious when transferring tokens to unknown addresses.
- Only the owner should have permission to mint tokens.
- Ensure proper access control and validation for redeeming game items.
- Always review and audit your contract before deploying it on the mainnet.
```

Feel free to modify and expand this template to include more details or specific usage instructions if needed. Additionally, you might want to add information about deployment, testing, and any dependencies your contract relies on.
